Clone repository into your github workflow and do tests on separate branch; any regular task-by-task pushes to main branch should be concise in commentary and frequent than by chucks. Files should be interpolatable, but since I set it up on macOS... so for whatever reason it does not work let me know so I can switch over to Windows installation and setup from there, or maybe someone else can just release a Windows setup to main branch on a separate repo.
